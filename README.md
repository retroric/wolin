# kotlinek
A modern, minimal Kotlin-like language for MOS 6502 / 6510

Currently supporting:

- functional programming (lambdas)
- exception handling
- if/else if
- do...while
- some OO

Generating assembler code for ca65 and memory config for Commodore 64

Very easy to port to other architectures via intermediate code to native code templates
